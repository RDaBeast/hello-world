hello world.

Hello, my name is Rory and as of this commit on 12/9/2018 I am new to the coding world. I have dabbled many a time but I have never really taken it seriously until now. I plan on learning all I can regarding full stack so I can start a career and start my life the right way, and have fun while doing it!
